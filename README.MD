## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [List all prerequisites for both frontend and backend, e.g., Node.js, npm/yarn, Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Docker Compose]

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/code_roast.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://github.com/your-username/code_roast.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd code_roast
    ```

2.  *(Frontend Installation Instructions - In the frontend README)*

3.  *(Backend Installation Instructions - In the backend README)*

4.  Set up environment variables:

    *   Create a `.env` file in the appropriate directories.  Add the necessary environment variables (database connection strings, API keys, secret keys, etc.). Example `.env` (backend):

        ```
        DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database_name
        REDIS_URL=redis://host:port
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key  # Generate a strong secret key
        # ... other environment variables
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  *(Backend Run Instructions - In the backend README)*

2.  *(Frontend Run Instructions - In the frontend README)*

3.  Access the application in your browser: `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate port).

## API Documentation

The backend API is documented using [Swagger/OpenAPI or a similar tool]. You can access the API documentation at `http://localhost:8080/docs` (or the appropriate URL). (Link to your API documentation if available.)

## Running Tests

*(Frontend Test Instructions - In the frontend README)*

*(Backend Test Instructions - In the backend README)*

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The `.github/workflows` directory contains the workflow configuration files. (Describe your CI/CD pipeline. What triggers it? What steps are involved: build, test, deploy?)

## Deployment

The application is deployed using Docker. (Describe your deployment process. Where is it deployed? How is it scaled?)

## Contributing

(Add contribution guidelines. How can others contribute? What are the coding standards?)

## License

(Specify the license. MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)
